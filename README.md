The aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data.

## Algorithms used:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* KMeans Clustering

## To run the code:
1. Clone the github repository in your computer. ```git clone https://github.com/Utkarsh-Shakya/Capstone_Project.git```
2. Run ```training.ipynb``` file.
3. Run ```testing.ipynb``` file.
4. That's it.

## To execute code from command prompt:
1. Open the command prompt
2. Make sure you are in the same directory as the testing code
3. Type ```python testing.py```
4. That's it again.
